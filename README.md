# FileGamble
File Gamble ðŸŽ²ðŸ’€

File Gamble is a simple yet risky game where players test their luck. If you guess incorrectly, one of your files gets deleted. If you keep winning, your score goes up. The game is entirely voluntary, and a Safe Mode exists for those who want to test it without real consequences.

ðŸš¨ Warning: This game deletes real files if not in Safe Mode (use t) when given a prompt. Play responsibly!
